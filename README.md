Update Sept 2018 - I have decided to stop supporting/developing this code any further - this is in the main part due to the excellent work carried out by both Eric Stockenstrom (zs6buj) - with his mavlink->FrSky Passthrough converter, and Alex Apostoli (yaapu) - with his awesome lua script (runs on Taranis, and Horus radios). You can find these projects here:

https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript

https://github.com/zs6buj/MavlinkToPassthru

I consider these new projects to be next-gen compared to the solution provided by the original project in this repo. These guys have done some groundbreaking work, so I would highly recommend you take a look. Best wishes, Paul A (athertop)
